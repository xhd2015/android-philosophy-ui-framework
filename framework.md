
This is an android framework, and the ideas underlying which maybe adopted into other responsive & subtle & fast UI programmings.

This framework contains the following parts:
    1.a sql/database proxy providing many general useful functions
    2.a ValueProvider that claims to provide value from or set value into different underlying containers.
    3.StandardFunctions & its handlers.
    4.The tuples whose idea is taken from C++ std::tuple,to support variable number of parameters.
    5.checkers before getting or setting value.
    6.viewwgetters by which the target filling view(s) are instantiated
    7.Different ValueType Transfers between different types,to support a database real value transfered into a user understandable value or vice versa.
    8.notations that helps to utilise the long going programming.

The power comes from the needs.
